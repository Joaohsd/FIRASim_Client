# fira-client


This repository contains a basic example for teams starting in the Very Small Size Soccer category and similar.

This example contains the reception of messages from the automatic Referee and the Fira-Sim simulator used in the Latin American Robotics Competition as well as sending messages to the simulator and to the robots' repositioning module.

# WARNING
This implementation is just a basic model. Teams must make adjustments that address the real need for their strategies.
